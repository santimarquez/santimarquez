# AI Skills

Reusable patterns for Cursor. Use these when generating or refactoring code.

## Purpose

Skills are templates or instructions for:
- Astro components (props, layout, i18n)
- Tailwind sections (design system, spacing, dark mode)
- Motion One usage (counters, reveals, hover)
- i18n and copy (impact statements, metrics)
- SVG diagrams (minimal, theme-consistent)

## Usage

In Cursor chat, e.g.:
- “Use the Astro section pattern for the Technical Stack”
- “Follow the design system for this card”
- “Add an animated counter like in the hero pattern”

## Adding skills

1. Add a new `.md` file in `ai/skills/`.
2. Describe: purpose, inputs, expected output, pattern or code snippet.
3. Mention the skill in this README.

## Reference

- Design system and patterns: `.cursorrules`, `ai/context/COMMON_PATTERNS.md`
- File locations: `ai/context/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
